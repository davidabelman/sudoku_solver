Python Su Doku Solver
=====================

Note this appears to work on most Su Doku's, but not the 'Super Fiendish' ones published occasionally by The Times. Maybe you can improve! A brief blog post explaining can be found at https://davidabelman.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/su-doku-challenge/.

Instructions
-----------
Running is simple. Input Su Doku must be saved as a CSV in the same folder as the script. Output CSV will also be saved here.

In the terminal, type:
>> python sudoku.py

Optional argument is the name of the CSV file, though if this is not provided you will be prompted to provide it later.

Nine boards are supplied within this repo (from The Times).
